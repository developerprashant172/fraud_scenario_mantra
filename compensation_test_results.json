However, since the user mentioned the amount deducted was ₹900, the compensation is capped at the deducted amount, so Rs 900. Correction: The calculation should be strictly Rs 100 per day of delay beyond T+1, so 25 days (from 15 Jan to 8 Feb) = Rs 2500. But since the rule does not mention capping, compensation is Rs 2500. Therefore, compensation amount is Rs 2500.",
